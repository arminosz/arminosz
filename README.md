# Hey there, I'm Arminosz :)

I'm just a guy who enjoys coding :p

Most of my experience is with **Java**, but lately, I've been diving into **Python** to expand my skills

### What I like to work on:
- Writing **QOL mods** (Quality of Life) to make things smoother.
- Building useful bots to automate stuff, solve problems, or just help out in some way

If you're into similar things, or just curious, feel free to check out my repositories  
I'm always learning and open to take some feedbacks!

I learn best by doing â€“ so don't expect perfect code, just stuff that works (usually) lmao
